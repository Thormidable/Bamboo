 RANDOM\_\-NUMBER
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item returns a Randomly generated number between 0.0f and 1.0f.\par
 SIGNAL()
\item A Class Type for passing Signals between Process', Render Objects and Collision Objects.\par
 \_\-KEY(KEY\_\-ID)
\item Function for accessing the array of key states. Takes Key ident as an input. Key Idents are defined in the Key List.\par
 \_\-MOUSE
\item Reference giving access the systems mouse states.\par
 \_\-LOAD(FileName)
\item Function for loading a file. Takes the filename as an input. Same as \_\-LOAD\_\-FILE(FileName);\par
 \_\-LOAD\_\-FILE(FileName)
\item Function for loading a file. Takes the filename as an input. Same as \_\-LOAD(FileName);\par
 \_\-GET\_\-FILE(FileType,FileName)
\item Function returning a pointer of type FileType to the IMF Object with the reference FileName.\par
 \_\-CREATE(Type)
\item Function operating like the new operator. Will create a new Process, Render Object or Collision Object and return a pointer of type Type.\par
 \_\-KILL()
\item Will Kill the current process.\par
 \_\-KILL(Pointer)
\item Will Kill the process pointed to by Pointer.\par
 \_\-SLEEP(Process)
\item Will Sleep the process pointer to by Process.\par
 \_\-WAKE(Process)
\item Will Wake the process pointed to by Process.\par
 \_\-SIGNAL(Flag)
\item Function which will send a signal to the process this function is called from, to signal the action, Flag. (Signal Flags are defined in the Signal List).\par
 \_\-USE\_\-SHADER(FileName)
\item Function telling the system to buffer for use the shader with reference FileName.\par
 \_\-GET\_\-SHADER(FileName)
\item Function returning a pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_shader}{cShader} Object with the reference FileName.\par
 \_\-USE\_\-FIXED\_\-FUNCTION()
\item Function telling the system to used the fixed function pipeline and not use shaders.\par
 \_\-CAMERA
\item A Pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_camera}{cCamera} Object.\par
 \_\-LIGHT
\item A Pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_light_handler}{cLightHandler} Object.\par
 \_\-KERNEL
\item A Pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_kernel}{cKernel} Object.\par
 \_\-FILE
\item A Pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_file_handler}{cFileHandler} Object.\par
 \_\-PAINTER
\item A Pointer to the \hyperlink{classc_painter}{cPainter} Object.\par
 \_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER
\item A Pointer to the cCollisionHandlerObject.\par
 \_\-RESET\_\-COLLISION
\item This will reset a stepping Collision Search, ready for a fresh search. (Not issue for Generating Collision Lists)\par
 WT\_\-TIME\_\-IND
\item This is the current frame length in seconds. Multiply anything time dependant by this to make it time independant. (It is a float multiplyer, think before use.)\par
 \_\-COLLISION\_\-PROCESS\_\-LOOP(lpList,lpVar)
\item This will start a Loop to step through a collision list. lpList should point to the Collision List and lpVar will point at the current process in the collision list.\par
 \_\-COLLISION\_\-RENDER\_\-LOOP(lpList,lpVar)
\item This will start a Loop to step through a collision list. lpList should point to the Collision List and lpVar will point at the current Render object in the collision list.\par
