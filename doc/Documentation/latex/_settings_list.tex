 WT\_\-USE\_\-PAINTER\_\-ALGORITHM
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This determines whether the system will render objects in the order they sit in the Render Tree, or to use the Painter Algorithm and sort them for speed.\par
 WT\_\-OPENGL\_\-LIGHTS
\item This is the number of Lights that you wish OpenGL to use simultaneously to light an object.\par
 USE\_\-LIGHT\_\-HANDLER
\item The light handler will determine the closest WT\_\-OPENGL\_\-LIGHTS to the object and render the object only using their influence. This allows the user to improve performance and / or use more lights than OpenGL can support.\par
 WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-TYPE WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-TYPE\_\-TYPE
\item This determines the Type of Collision handler used to sort Collisions. It can be set to either WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-TYPE\_\-TYPE or WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-TYPE\_\-BSP.\par
 WT\_\-RAY\_\-ANGLE\_\-RANGE
\item Ummmm, something to do with Ray Angles.\par
 WT\_\-ALLOW\_\-DYNAMIC\_\-TEXTURES
\item This determines whether the user wants to be able to update textures once loaded into memory. Being able to do so will result in a reduction in performance.\par
 WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-SIZE
\item This will set the number of slots that the Collision Handler will use for filtering collisions. See relevant documentation.\par
 WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-DIMENSIONS
\item This sets the number of dimensions the BSP Collision Handler should use (1,2 or 3) WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-DIMENSIONS\_\-1D,WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-DIMENSIONS\_\-2D, WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-HANDLER\_\-DIMENSIONS\_\-3D.\par
 WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-SPACE\_\-SIZE
\item This is the spatial size of each slot for the BSP. It should be at least (preferably more) than half the largest object size, that will be involved in collisions.\par
 WT\_\-DEFINE\_\-OS
\item This is the OS that the engine is running under. So far OS\_\-LINUX or OS\_\-WINDOWS.\par
 WT\_\-COLLISION\_\-DEPTH
\item This shouldn't be used anymore. Why did I leave it in here. Was from the good ol' days of Collision Trees.\par
 \_\-GRAVITY\_\-X
\item This is the X Axis value of gravity, to be used by particle objects.\par
 \_\-GRAVITY\_\-Y
\item This is the Y Axis value of gravity, to be used by particle objects.\par
 \_\-GRAVITY\_\-Z
\item This is the Z Axis value of gravity, to be used by particle objects.\par
 \_\-WIND\_\-X
\item This is the X Axis value of wind, to be used by particle objects.\par
 \_\-WIND\_\-Y
\item This is the Y Axis value of wind, to be used by particle objects.\par
 \_\-WIND\_\-Z
\item This is the Z Axis value of wind, to be used by particle objects.\par
 WT\_\-MAX\_\-PARTICLES
\item This is the maximum particles that \hyperlink{classc_particle_handler}{cParticleHandler} should need to maintain at any one time.\par
 WT\_\-PARTICLE\_\-HANDLER\_\-UPDATE\_\-PARTICLE\_\-POSITIONS
\item When true, the Particle handler will automatically update the particles speed and position based on Wind and Gravity.\par
 WT\_\-VERTEX\_\-RANGE\_\-CHECK\_\-SIMILAR
\item This is the maximum allowed distance between verteces in a collision object for them to be counted as a single vertex.\par
 WT\_\-USE\_\-PARENT\_\-STACK
\item This will determine whether the system should automatically track each process' parent and children.\par
