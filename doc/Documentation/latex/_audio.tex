How to use the Audio System by William Thorley.

The class \hyperlink{classc_audio_object}{cAudioObject} are used to play sounds from the sound card. Currently sound files are loaded by creating a new cWav() with the file path and name as the first argument. They will be added to the file list in \hyperlink{classc_file_handler}{cFileHandler} and can be found by searching the list for the filepath and name, once sound files are added to IMF files they will be loaded with the \_\-LOAD() macro.. A Sound file is passed to the buffer and played with the Play() command. When the sound is played it will take up a channel on the sound card.


\begin{DoxyCode}
  * // Load the Sound file
 mWav = new cWav("./User/Audio/wave1.wav");
 //Create the cAudioObject to buffer the sound file in.
 mAO = new cAudioObject;
 //Load the sound file into the buffer
 mAO->SetBuffer(mWav);
 //Play the sound
 mAO->Play();
\end{DoxyCode}
