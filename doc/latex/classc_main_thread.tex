This Class is responsible for initialising and starting the Program. This is so the program can be created from a single line. 


\begin{DoxyTemplParams}{Template Parameters}
{\em cX} & This is the class that will first be called (The Core Process -\/ it must inherit \hyperlink{classc_process}{cProcess}) and will initialise and start the game. \\
\hline
{\em cS} & This is the class that will be used for doing the Settings for the game and engine (it must inherit cUserSettings). This will create a window. Initialise the Engine and Create the first process -\/ of type cX, before entering the main loop. This version of the class is for Windows. This is best called using the macro \_\-START\_\-PROGRAM(TYPE,SETTINGS).\\
