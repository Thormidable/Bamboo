This is a Texture rendered onto a plane, which can be moved as a 3D object. This literally produces a 2D image on a plane in 3D. This can be mvoed like any other object This is good for producing billboards or in game HUDS or screens. Other than specified functions operates in the same way as the class \hyperlink{classc_image}{cImage}. Check the facing of the plane to be sure it displays.
