Class for handling user specified signals sent between classes inheriting \hyperlink{classc_process}{cProcess}. The function UserSignal should be defined for each object. The signals each class has defined can be independant. The code for processing the signal should be defined in UserSignal as there is no signal buffer. This should be used for dealing with Process interactions, to make a single point of detection of interaction and allowing both processes to handle the interaction. System signals (sleep, wake and kill) should be handled through \hyperlink{classc_signal}{cSignal}.
