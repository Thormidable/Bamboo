<p>This is a user defined function allowing the user to add Process specific inter-process signals. This Function should include the code for processing the signal as there is no signal buffer. It is useful to ensure a single detection and activation of process interactions. One Process shoudl detect the interaction and signal the other to respond. This way the order of Process evaluation is unimportant. </p>
