This holds the data for a 3D model in a format suitable for rendering. The data is stored in 2 large arrays with the face data stored in the array mpFaces while all the remaining data stored is stored consecutively in mpVertex. mpVertex points to the start of the array while mpNormals and mpUV point to the start of their respective data blocks. UVSpheres are generated from another mesh. Icosphere meshes give good rugged UVSpheres, but any mesh can be used to give some control over the final shape of the UVSphere </td></tr>
