/**
* \brief This is a dynamic render tree branch.
 * This class stores a dynamic list of cRenderObjects called mpObjects. cRenderNode inherits cRenderObject and so
 * can be stored in mpObjects of other cRenderNodes. Any translations applied to this cRenderNode will modify the
 * base coordinates of any objects stored in mpObjects. This allows objects to be grouped for the purposes of translations.
 * A cRenderNode volume encompasses all objects beneath it in the render tree, this increases the speed of collision
 * searches as a cRenderNode can remove all it's sub objects from the search. cRenderNode is the dynamic equivalent of cNodeList.
 * cRenderNode is good for building structures which regularly change or are hard to predict the shape of.
