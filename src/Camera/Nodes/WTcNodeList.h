* \brief Node list is a 'static' render tree holding data for a series of renderable objects. It counts as a single renderable object.
* \param lpTree a pointer to the cMeshTree object loaded from cIMF::LoadIMF()
* \param lpRenderer Places this object beneath lpRenderer in the scene graph.
* This is another type of Render Node. Similar to cRenderNode. cRenderNode is a dynamic Node designed for shallow trees with regularly changing sizes and shapes.
* cNodeList is a 'static' Node designed for deep trees which do not regularly change. These can be loaded from files (Mesh Trees). And are suitable for building structures with lots of components glued to other components.
* Each object is given a depth. The object will base its co-ordinate system off the last object with a lower depth value.
* cNodeList holds a static array of cNodeListNode. cNodeListNode holds all the relative data about each object in the render tree.
* cNodeList objects loaded from files are cModel objects. cNodeLists can have cRenderNodes or cNodeLists as parents. They can contain any Render Object which includes cRenderNodes or cNodeLists.
* Just Pass the pointer to the cNodeList which you want to parent a new object and it will add itself to the cNodeList.
* It is more efficient to build a single large cNodeList than to put one inside another. Global Rotations are mapped as Local Rotations inside cNodeList as the objects are deemed to be glued and so are limited to Local Rotations.
* cRenderNode s fully support Global Rotations.
