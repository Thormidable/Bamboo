* This class should be inherited by any renderable object. If it is handed
* no parameters then it will add itself to cCamera::mpRenderList, which is owned
* by cCamera. If you wish to produce a scene graph, the new renderable object can
* be handed a pointer to a cRenderNode. Any translations applied to lpNode will
* change the co-ordinate system for this renderable object.

* \endcode
* After this code mpObject will be at 2.0f,0.0f,0.0.
* This Function should only be used for Creating New Renderable Object Types. It should be virtual.
