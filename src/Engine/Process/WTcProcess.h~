* Initialisation code should go in the constructor of the user type. Linking to cKernel is performed automatically by cProcess.
* Update code should go in the function Run().
* Destruction code should fo in the destructor of the user type.
* Code to handle interaction of two processes should go in either processes UserSignal() function.
